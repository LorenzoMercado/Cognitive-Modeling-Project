# CNN Robustness
This project is a small analysis of adding gaussian noise to the training of a convolution neural network to improve robustness against noise.
## Files
The CNN_Noise_Robustness.ipynb file is the file which handles all the training of the networks.  
It records the performance of the models in the robustness.csv file.  
These results are analyzed and visualized in the results.ipynb file.
